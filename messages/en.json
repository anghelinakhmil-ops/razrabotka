In 2024, this is especially relevant for business websites where SEO, loading speed, and scalability matter.</p><p>In this article, we'll break down why we choose Next.js for commercial projects and what advantages it gives our clients.</p><h2 id=\"seo\">Built-in SEO</h2><p>The main advantage of Next.js for business is excellent SEO. Unlike regular React applications, Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).</p><p>This means search engines see a fully rendered page rather than empty HTML with JavaScript. The result is fast indexing and high search rankings.</p><ul><li>Automatic meta tag generation</li><li>Built-in Open Graph support</li><li>Automatic sitemap.xml</li><li>Core Web Vitals optimization</li></ul><h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2><p>Next.js optimizes performance at the framework level. Automatic code splitting, image optimization, link prefetching — all of this works out of the box.</p><p>For business, this is critical: every second of loading delay can cost conversions. With Next.js, we consistently achieve Lighthouse Scores of 90+.</p><h2 id=\"dx\">Developer Experience</h2><p>Good DX means fast development and fewer bugs. Next.js provides:</p><ul><li>Hot Module Replacement for instant changes</li><li>TypeScript out of the box</li><li>Built-in API Routes</li><li>Excellent documentation and community</li></ul><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusions</h2><p>Next.js isn't just a trendy framework — it's a tool that solves real business problems. SEO, performance, scalability — all out of the box.</p><p>If you're planning to build a website that needs to bring clients from search and convert visitors — Next.js is the right choice.</p>"
